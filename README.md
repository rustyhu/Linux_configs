Configurations
================

It is my Linux configurations here.<br>

I have an idea to make this git repo more efficient and tidy, maybe a way to reach my original purpose to build a auto-deployed collection of the configuration files of the tools I use frequently.

Obviously it is better for collecting and managing to put these config files of different softwares together, in one git; but it is not convenient to use when deploying them in a specific OS or some specific environment as these softwares are usually installed in different directories.

So I had better write a script to distribute these config files. <br>
